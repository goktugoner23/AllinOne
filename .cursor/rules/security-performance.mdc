# Security & Performance Guidelines
Best practices for secure and performant Android applications.

## Performance & Security

[UseProguardOrR8]
description = "Enable code shrinking (R8/ProGuard) for release builds."
rationale = "Decreases app size and may obfuscate code to hinder reverse-engineering."
enforce = recommended

[MinimizeUseOfReflection]
description = "Reflection can be expensive; avoid it except where absolutely necessary."
rationale = "Reduces runtime overhead and potential security vulnerabilities."
enforce = recommended

[AvoidStoringSensitiveDataPlaintext]
description = "Never store API keys or user credentials in plaintext within the app."
rationale = "Protects sensitive information from reverse-engineering and misuse."
enforce = true

[SecureNetworkCommunications]
description = "Use HTTPS/TLS for all network traffic. Validate certificates and server configurations when appropriate."
rationale = "Protects user data and ensures app security."
enforce = true

[LimitMemoryUsage]
description = "Be mindful of memory usage, especially when handling images and large data sets."
rationale = "Prevents OutOfMemoryError crashes and improves overall app performance."
enforce = recommended

[OptimizeLayoutHierarchy]
description = "Keep view hierarchies flat and optimize layouts for performance."
rationale = "Improves UI rendering performance, especially on lower-end devices."
enforce = recommended

[SecureDataStorage]
description = "Use EncryptedSharedPreferences or other secure storage for sensitive data."
rationale = "Protects user data from unauthorized access."
enforce = true

[ProperPermissionUsage]
description = "Request minimal necessary permissions and explain why they're needed to users."
rationale = "Improves user trust and follows Android best practices for permissions."
enforce = true
