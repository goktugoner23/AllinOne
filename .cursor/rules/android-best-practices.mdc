# Android Best Practices
Guidelines for effective Android development including UI, threading, and components.

## Android-Specific Guidelines

[UseAndroidXDependencies]
description = "Always use AndroidX libraries instead of legacy support libraries."
rationale = "AndroidX is actively maintained and future-proof."
enforce = true

[UseViewBindingOrJetpackCompose]
description = "Use View Binding or Jetpack Compose for UI to reduce boilerplate and runtime errors."
rationale = "Increases type safety, reduces the risk of NullPointerExceptions, and is more maintainable."
enforce = recommended

[AvoidBlockingMainThread]
description = "Long-running tasks or I/O operations should never block the main thread."
rationale = "Ensures the app remains responsive. Offload heavy work using coroutines, WorkManager, or background threads."
enforce = true

[UseCoroutinesForAsync]
description = "Use `kotlinx.coroutines` to handle asynchronous tasks."
rationale = "Structured concurrency is more readable and maintains lifecycle awareness using `CoroutineScope` and `SupervisorJob`."
example_ok = "viewModelScope.launch { ... }"
enforce = true

[UseViewModelForStateHandling]
description = "Leverage Android Architecture Components (ViewModel) for managing UI-related data."
rationale = "Ensures data survives configuration changes and provides clear separation of concerns."
enforce = recommended

[UseDependencyInjection]
description = "Utilize dependency injection frameworks (e.g., Hilt, Koin) to manage app dependencies."
rationale = "Improves testability and decouples business logic from platform/framework code."
enforce = recommended

[UseResourceFilesAppropriately]
description = "All strings, dimensions, and colors should be defined in resource files."
rationale = "Enables localization, improves consistency across the app."
enforce = true

[UseFragmentFactory]
description = "Use FragmentFactory for creating fragments with non-empty constructors."
rationale = "Allows dependency injection into Fragments and avoids using newInstance() static methods."
enforce = recommended

[LifecycleAwareness]
description = "Be mindful of Android lifecycle when performing operations in components."
rationale = "Prevents memory leaks and crashes due to operations on destroyed components."
enforce = true
